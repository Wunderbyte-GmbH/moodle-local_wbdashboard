/**
 * Optional source capability: provide grouped options for a select control.
 *
 * A source implementing this can populate a [chartfilter type=groupedselect]
 * dropdown whose options are visually grouped by a second field (e.g. ASL
 * options grouped under their REGION). Values must still be usable as a
 * constraint on the control's own key, exactly like {@see option_provider_interface}.
 *
 * When a scope value is supplied, only the matching group is returned — this is
 * how a viewer locked to one group (e.g. a regional manager) sees just their
 * own group's options. Callers check instanceof and fall back to static/flat
 * options when a source does not implement it.
